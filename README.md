# JD Bucklin

I am self-taught and have been exploring, studying, and using AI for years. I am also passionate about protecting autonomy of thought.

## Book

I wrote and published the book [AI A Book by ChatGPT & Me](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVY3FM3Z?ref_=k4w_ss_store_lp) using ChatGPT as a thought experiment. It was a fascinating journey and through that I was able to learn and share a lot about the potential of AI to augment and enhance human creativity as well as the importance of implementing AI with intention.

I am always working to learn more and improve my skills.
